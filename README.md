# Diavlo V1
You're lost in the underworld, the only way to escape is to fight the boss of each circle of Hell. The catch? It's metal as hell!

# Description
Diavlo is a 3D single-player RPG rhythm game. Built with Unity. 
The music is original, composed and recorded by Daniel Rusetski, my partner in creating the game. H elao sworked on the animation, graphics and other VFX and SFX.
I coded the majority of the game, creating all major scripts which did not correspond to animation.
